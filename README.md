## 📊 The Cosmic Hash Algorithm

Your birth moment = unique cosmic coordinates → astronomical calculations → sacred geometry → AI interpretation → personalized blueprint

Each Hash Clock signature is mathematically unique, encoding:
- Precise planetary positions at birth moment
- Geographic coordinate influence
- Temporal harmonic resonances  
- Geometric aspect patterns
- Statistical rarity factors

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Jeton × Gufram Aesthetic**: Clean geometric forms meet cosmic wonder
- **Colors**: Deep space (#0a0e27), cosmic purple (#6b46c1), stardust white (#f9fafb), accent gold (#fbbf24)
- **Typography**: Inter for clarity, Cormorant for mystical headers
- **Animations**: Subtle starfield, floating elements, cosmic loader
- **UX**: Divine minimalism with maximum impact

## 🔮 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
// Generate cosmic report
const chartData = await generateReport(birthData);
const aiReport = await generateAiReport(chartData);
```

### Sacred Geometry
```javascript
// Create unique pattern
const pattern = generateSacredGeometryPattern(birthData);
setGeometryPattern(pattern); // Updates visual display
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
npm run build
npx vercel --prod
```

### Netlify
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to Netlify
```
