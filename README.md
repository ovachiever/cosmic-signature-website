## Project Overview
This project is a cosmic astrology report website built following the KISS-CELLENCEâ„¢ philosophy of divine simplicity. The website allows users to enter their birth details and receive a beautifully designed cosmic signature report.

## Features
- Single page application with smooth scroll sections
- Birth data input form with date, time, and location fields
- Real astronomy calculations using the astronomy-engine library
- Beautiful cosmic report generation with unique insights
- Supabase integration for content storage
- Responsive design with cosmic aesthetic

## Tech Stack
- React for the frontend
- Tailwind CSS for styling (via utility classes)
- astronomy-engine for celestial calculations
- Supabase for content storage

   - Configure the build settings (build command: `pnpm run build`, output directory: `dist`)
   - Click Deploy

## Implementation Notes
- The astronomy calculations are performed using the astronomy-engine library
- The sacred geometry patterns are generated based on birth chart data
- The cosmic terminology and report templates are stored in Supabase
- The application follows the KISS-CELLENCEâ„¢ philosophy of shipping quickly with divine simplicity

## Future Enhancements (v2)
